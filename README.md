# 📦 ServMods MC

A simple tool to automatically import your Minecraft server-side mods into the correct folder, hassle-free.

## 🚀 Features

- 📂 **Automatic import** of Minecraft mods into the correct directory (Only from modrinth modpack for now, but it will be improved to work with others later).
- 🛠️ **Compatible with Fabric, Forge, NeoForge...**.

## 🖥️ Installation & run
First install the script into your VPS with ;
```bash
Wait a second i'll add it in a minute
```
Then run this to make it executable
```bash
chmod +x ServMod.sh
```
Then run the script using :
```bash
./ServModMC.sh --link [YOUR_MODPACK_LINK] --dir [YOUR_SERVER_DIRECTORY]
```

### 📌 Requirements

- A VPS running Ubuntu (maybe it'll work with other distros, test yourself) (or your computer but for now it only works on Ubuntu) and a CLI acces to it
- Some dependencies such as curl, jq and unzip. You can download them by using :
```bash
sudo apt install curl jq unzip
```
