# (WIP) 📦 ServMods MC

A simple tool to automatically import your Minecraft server-side mods into the correct folder, hassle-free.

## 🚀 Features

- 📂 **Automatic import** of Minecraft mods into the correct directory (Only from modrinth modpack for now, but it will be improved to work with others later).
- 🛠️ **Compatible with Fabric servers** (others will be added later).

## 🖥️ Installation
Not available yet, I want to make sure it works well, which is'nt true right now.

### 📌 Requirements

- A VPS and a CLI acces to it
- It will automatically download required dependencies such as curl, jq and unzip.
